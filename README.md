# FUTURE_UIUX_TaskNumber-3
I designed a Freelancer Collaboration Platform UI in Figma, inspired by platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, with the aim of delivering a professional, simple, and user-focused experience. The purpose of this project was to create a digital space that connects clients and freelancers efficiently while maintaining trust, clarity, and usability.
